Inspired by ["Ireland's longest.ie website is just word 'Cork' repeated 15 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1ikevd6/irelands_longest_ie_website_is_just_the_word_cork/) on Reddit, I just had to go 3 characters better.

TLD's are limited to a max of 63 characters, which fits 'Tipperary' repeated 7 times, and more importantly is longer and therefore better than Cork's attempt.
